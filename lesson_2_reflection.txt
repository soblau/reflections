How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I was able to look at only one text file instead of two and
I only had to look at the lines where something had changed, as opposed to the whole document.

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It initialises an empty repository in the open folder. It is empty, so need to decide which files to include in the repository base line for subsequent changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a temporary space where you store files from the working directory before committing them to the repository. The value in this is e.g. if a large commit is made up of several files, you can store each file as you finish working on it to the staging area and review before committing
